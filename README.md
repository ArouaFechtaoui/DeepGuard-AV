# DeepGuard-AV
A multimodal deepfake detection system using the HiDF dataset. It employs three CNNs: MTCNN for face detection, a 3D CNN for visual spatio-temporal analysis, and a 2D CNN for audio feature extraction. The fused model detects inconsistencies between speech and facial motion to classify videos as real or fake.
